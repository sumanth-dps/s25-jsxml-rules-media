      <h3>Plot:--</h3>
      <p className="paraTwo">
        In 3102 BC, following the Kurukshetra War, Ashwatthama attempts to kill
        Uttarā's unborn child by invoking the Brahmashirastra, a godly weapon of
        unimaginable destruction. For committing the act, Krishna, the 8th
        reincarnation of Vishnu, curses him to roam the earth as an immortal and
        witness humanity's misery as a result of societal and moral
        deterioration in the Kali Yuga. His divine gem is also taken from his
        forehead, and his redemption is destined to occur through protecting the
        mother of Vishnu's next reincarnation, Kalki, towards the end of Kali
        Yuga. In 2898 AD, six thousand years after the events of the Kurukshetra
        War, the desertified city of Kasi stands as the last known city in a
        post-apocalyptic world dominated by Supreme Yaskin, a totalitarian
        god-king. Yaskin rules from the "Complex", an
        inverted-pyramidal-megastructure that hovers above the city, extracting
        Earth's resources to sustain a gated paradise accessible only to those
        who can pay 1 million "units". His authority is enforced by Commander
        Manas, Counsellor Bani and the Raiders, who vigilantly guard against
        threats, particularly the prophesied arrival of Kalki. In this dystopian
        society, fertile female refugees in Kasi are forcibly taken to the
        Complex for Project K, an experiment aimed at producing a life-extending
        serum for the 200-year-old Yaskin through artificially inseminated
        foetuses. However, no woman survives more than 120 days of pregnancy,
        resulting in their deaths. Raia, a young girl disguised as a boy,
        narrowly escapes conscription with the help of rebels led by Rumi from
        the hidden city of Shambhala. Rumi and Divya, a pregnant woman believed
        to be carrying Kalki, are captured and publicly executed by Manas for
        refusing to reveal Shambhala's location. After Manas sets a bounty on
        Shambhala rebels, Raia finds refuge in a cave where she encounters
        Ashwatthama. She unknowingly brings him his divine gem, Shivamani, which
        has been found by and passed on among the Shambhala rebels. Together,
        they set out to find the real mother of Kalki. SUM-80, a Project K
        subject hiding her 150-day pregnancy, is eventually ousted and captured.
        Manas extracts a single drop of serum from her foetus before the
        procedure is interrupted by Lilly, a Shambhala rebel posing as a Project
        K subject. Lilly helps SUM-80 escape the lab, but stays behind to hold
        off the Raiders. SUM-80 is received by Veeran, Kyra, and Ajju, Shambhala
        rebels contacted by Lilly. Kyra renames SUM-80 as "Sumathi". En route to
        Shambhala, their convoy is ambushed by bounty hunters and Raiders after
        Manas places a bounty on Sumathi. Though they fend off the attackers,
        Kyra is killed. Bhairava, a bounty hunter aiming to secure Sumathi's
        bounty to enter the Complex, remains in pursuit with his AI supercar,
        Bujji. Ashwatthama learns through his gem that Sumathi's unborn child is
        Kalki. Despite Bhairava's efforts, Ashwatthama subdues him and the party
        reaches Shambhala, where the tree of life blooms in Kalki's presence.
        Bhairava makes a deal with Manas to capture Sumathi in exchange for his
        entry into the Complex. Bhairava discovers Shambhala by deceiving a
        rebel, Luke, and disguises himself as Ashwatthama by using his hologram
        technology. He convinces Sumathi to flee Shambhala, but they are
        intercepted by the real Ashwatthama. As they fight, Shambhala's leader,
        Mariam, attempts to take Sumathi away to safety. Manas and the Raiders
        track Bhairava to Shambhala and breach its defences with a beam weapon.
        The Raiders overwhelm the Shambhalan army, and Mariam is killed after
        slashing Manas' face. He then chains Ashwatthama, whose walking stick
        falls into the unconscious Bhairava's hands, where it is actually
        revealed to be Karna's bow, the Vijaya Dhanush. Bhairava wield Karna bow
        and gain its power, possibly hinting him as descendant of Karna.
        Bhairava effortlessly defends Sumathi and Ashwatthama against the
        Raiders. Bhairava uses the bow to rescue Sumathi and kill Manas.
        Ashwatthama, recognising his former friend and brother-in-arms, breaks
        free, but Bhairava reverts to his former self due to a distraction
        caused by Bujji and takes Sumathi away. Back at the Complex, Yaskin is
        informed of Manas's failure and death by Counsellor Bani. He uses the
        extracted serum drop to transform into a much younger superhuman. He
        picks up Arjuna's bow, Gandiva, and declares to personally capture
        Sumathi and her child to reshape the world
